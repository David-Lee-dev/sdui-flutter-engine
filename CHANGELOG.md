# Changelog

## 0.2.3

- Fix: an `image` that is still loading (the pending path) now receives its
  parent's constraints unchanged. Previously the load cross-fade loosened them,
  so in a fixed slot the image sized to its own aspect ratio and `fit` (e.g.
  `cover`) could not fill the slot. Pending and ready images now lay out alike.

## 0.2.2

- `video` widget: `on_ready` and `on_error` props. `on_ready` dispatches once a
  slot first becomes renderable for the current `src` (direct and
  `SharedVideoScope`-leased paths); `on_error` dispatches once if initialization
  fails. A `src` change resets both guards.

## 0.2.1

- Fix: motions inside a `Scrollable` ancestor (any depth, including `swipe_pane`
  followers moved by `jumpTo`) no longer start on mount. They wait until the
  widget is actually visible in every ancestor viewport and scrolling has
  settled, then run their `delay` from that point. Motions outside any
  scrollable are unaffected. A `trigger` change still restarts immediately,
  bypassing the wait; once a motion has started, scrolling it away and back
  never restarts it.

## 0.2.0

- Page transitions: `_transition` decoder and effect registry with `slide_up`, `zoom`,
  `fade_through`, `shared_axis`, `container_transform`, `card_stack`, `tap_zoom`, and `none`.
- `shared_element` widget: snapshot Hero flight for any widget, follows iOS swipe-back,
  continuous video across the flight.
- Destination preload; push uses the destination's declared transition.
- `PlayerVideoController.asset/network` accept `VideoPlayerOptions`.
- Fix: `navigate` push settles when the pushed page leaves without a pop.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release: JSON template compiler into a reactive widget tree with actions,
  drivers, motion, transport-blind `NetworkClient`, language catalog, and replaceable
  error/presentation surfaces.
